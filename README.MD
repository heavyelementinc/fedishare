# Fedishare
What is Fedishare? It's a simple library for querying Fediverse servies and 
redirecting your website's visitors to supported share pages.

I built this for my website [The Bryant Review](https://gardinerbryant.com) and 
I wrote an article about my [implementation here](https://gardinerbryant.com/how-i-built-intelligent-fediverse-buttons-for-the-review/).

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, I welcome collaborators, and feature
requests!
